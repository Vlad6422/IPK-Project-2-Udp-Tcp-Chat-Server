# IPK24 Chat ServerðŸ”®

This is a simple chat server application developed in C# to facilitate communication with chat clients. The server supports both TCP and UDP transport protocols for client connections.

## Download and SetupðŸ’»

1. **Clone the repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://git.fit.vutbr.cz/xmalas04/ipk-project2.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Change your current directory to the cloned project folder:

    ```bash
    cd ipk-project2
    ```

3. **Build the project:** Build the application using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    make
    ```
4. **Run the server** Run the server:
    ```bash
    ./ipk24chat-server -l 0.0.0.0 -p 4567 -d 250 -r 3
    ```

## Command Line ArgumentsðŸŽ“

The server program accepts the following command line arguments:

- `-l <IP>`: IP address to listen on for incoming connections (mandatory).
- `-p <port>`: Port number to listen on for incoming connections (mandatory).
- `-d <timeout>`: UDP confirmation timeout (default is 250).
- `-r <retransmissions>`: Maximum number of UDP retransmissions (default is 3).
- `-h`: Prints program help output and exits.

Example usage:
```bash
./ipk24chat-server -l 0.0.0.0 -p 4567 -d 250 -r 3
```

## Program BehaviorðŸ“˜

### Client Communication

- **User Authentication (`AUTH`):** The server handles initial user authentication upon client connection. Once authenticated, the server automatically joins the user to a default channel.
  
- **Channel Join (`JOIN`):** Users can join specific channels after successful authentication. The server creates the channel if it doesn't exist and broadcasts a message to other users in the channel upon successful join.

- **Sending Messages (`MSG`):** Authenticated users can send messages to channels they have joined. The server forwards these messages to other users in the same channel, excluding the sender.

- **Error Handling (`ERR`):** The server gracefully handles any errors received from clients, terminating the corresponding user session if needed.

- **Session Termination (`BYE`):** Upon receiving a `BYE` message, the server cleans up resources associated with the user's session and removes them from any joined channels.

### Logging

The server logs incoming and outgoing messages in the following format to standard output (stdout):

```
RECV {FROM_IP}:{FROM_PORT} | {MESSAGE_TYPE}[MESSAGE_CONTENTS]
SENT {TO_IP}:{TO_PORT} | {MESSAGE_TYPE}[MESSAGE_CONTENTS]
```

Where `{MESSAGE_TYPE}` corresponds to message type keywords (`AUTH`, `JOIN`, `MSG`, `ERR`, `BYE`), and `{MESSAGE_CONTENTS}` includes relevant message details (e.g., `Username=user1 DisplayName=User1 Secret=xXx`).

## Testing the IPK24 Chat Server ApplicationðŸ”Ž

### Automated TestingâŒ›

Automated testing ensures the reliability and functionality of the IPK24 Chat Server across various scenarios. Input files with predefined commands and expected server responses are used to validate application behavior.

#### Testing Scenarios:

1. **Basic Functionality Test:** Verifies fundamental server features such as user authentication, channel joining, message sending, and error handling.

2. **Error Handling Test:** Validates the server's ability to handle erroneous commands and unexpected client responses effectively.

3. **Performance Test:** Tests the server's responsiveness and scalability under different load conditions.

#### Testing Input File:

An example testing input file (`testing_input.txt`) contains predefined commands and expected server responses, allowing comprehensive testing of application functionality.


### Testing Input File Structure

The `testing_input.txt` file appears to follow this structure:

1. **Commands Sent by Users**:
   - Text that TCP/UDP users send to the server.

2. **Commands and Responses**:
   - Commands from users (`/auth username DisplayName token`, `hello`, `My name is Ivan`, `/join News`).
   - Expected server responses with format details (`RECV` for messages received by the server, `SENT` for messages sent by the server).
   - Server responses differ based on whether the user is using TCP or UDP.

### Example Content Breakdown

Here's how you might interpret the example content you've provided:

- **Text Sent by TCP/UDP Users**:
  ```
  add here text that user Tcp sends
  /auth username DisplayName token
  hello
  My name is Ivan
  /join News
  ```

- **Expected Server Responses for TCP Users**:
  ```
  RECV 127.0.0.1:51364 | AUTH
  SENT 127.0.0.1:51364 | REPLY
  RECV 127.0.0.1:51364 | MSG
  RECV 127.0.0.1:51364 | MSG
  RECV 127.0.0.1:51364 | JOIN
  SENT 127.0.0.1:51364 | REPLY
  RECV 127.0.0.1:51364 | BYE
  ```

- **Expected Server Responses for UDP Users**:
  ```
  RECV 127.0.0.1:51364 | AUTH
  SENT 127.0.0.1:51364 | CONFIRM
  SENT 127.0.0.1:51364 | REPLY
  RECV 127.0.0.1:51364 | CONFIRM

  RECV 127.0.0.1:51364 | BYE
  SENT 127.0.0.1:51364 | CONFIRM
  ```

### Explanation of Server Responses

- **TCP Server Responses**:
  - `RECV`: Server receives a message from the client.
  - `SENT`: Server sends a response back to the client.

- **UDP Server Responses**:
  - Similar format as TCP but with additional `CONFIRM` messages indicating acknowledgments for UDP communication.

### Usage
This structured testing input file (`testing_input.txt`) can be used to automate testing of your application's interaction with the server. By processing the commands and verifying the server responses against the expected outputs, you can ensure the correct behavior of your application under different scenarios for both TCP and UDP users.
